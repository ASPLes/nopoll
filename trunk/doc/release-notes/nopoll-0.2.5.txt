                          0.2.5

Advanced Software Production Line is proud to announce a new stable
release of the noPoll toolkit.

noPoll is a OpenSource WebSocket implementation (RFC 6455), written in
ANSI C, that allows building pure WebSocket solutions or to provide
WebSocket support to existing TCP oriented applications.

Commercially supported, noPoll was written to have a clean, easy to
use and integrate library. It is released under the terms of LGPL 2.1
(so you can build OpenSource or commercial applications) and currently
is being heavily used by Vortex Library, Turbulence and Core-Admin to
provide WebSocket support to those projects (some of them using BEEP
over WebSocket).

This release in short
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  New stable release that support reading partial frames (part of the
  header or part of the mask) without consider that as a failure and
  without blocking the caller. Next calls will reuse those bytes to
  try to complete incoming data.

Changes from previous release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* [fix] Several updates to add additional logging information. Updated
  conn_id handling to move it into the context (instead of a global
  variable which tends to cause races in threaded applications).

* [fix] Updated noPoll Connection API to include support to notify
  connection close. API added:
  
  - nopoll_conn_set_on_close
  - noPollOnCloseHandler

* [new] Added new API functions that allows sending binary frames (op
  code 2). API added:

  - nopoll_conn_send_binary
  - nopoll_conn_send_binary_fragment

* [fix] Added SSP gcc compiler options by default.

* [fix] Renamed private parameter to private_key at
  nopoll_listener_set_certificate so c++ can get get this
  compiled. Reported by Mike.

* [fix] Various modifications to make the project to be compilable
  with c++ tools. Bug reported by Ali kim

* [fix] More c++ begin c decls fixings..

* [fix] Fixed wrong reference to __file__ (was pointing to __LINE__)
  inside nopoll_log.h (for win32 compilation).  Reported by fixed
  Serge.

* [fix] Added some additional nopoll_base64_encode cleanups to ensure
  all resources are released under error. Checked call to flush
  internal BIO.

* [fix] Fixed compilation warning at nopoll_conn.c (due to unused
   variable when SHOW_DEBUG_LOG isn't defined).

* [fix] Updated regression code to detect some cases where listener is
   not able to send at a particular moment.

* [fix] Some additional modifications to make the regression test to
  work..  ...on windows 32 xp..
