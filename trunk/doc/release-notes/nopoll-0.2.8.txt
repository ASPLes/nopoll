                       Old Enough
                          0.2.8

Advanced Software Production Line is proud to announce a new stable
release of the noPoll toolkit.

noPoll is a OpenSource WebSocket implementation (RFC 6455), written in
ANSI C, that allows building pure WebSocket solutions or to provide
WebSocket support to existing TCP oriented applications.

Commercially supported, noPoll was written to have a clean, easy to
use and integrate library. It is released under the terms of LGPL 2.1
(so you can build OpenSource or commercial applications) and currently
is being heavily used by Vortex Library, Turbulence and Core-Admin to
provide WebSocket support to those projects (some of them using BEEP
over WebSocket).

This release in short
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  General API update to allow configuring TLS/SSL process by
  installing handlers that allows to create the SSL context or to
  implement a verification postfix. Added ready to use support to
  implement certificate peer verification (from client and server
  side).

Changes from previous release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* [new] Several API updates to allow userland to define a set of
  functions that can be used to expand and customize the SSL/TLS
  configuration by allowing to create the context that is going to be
  used by the noPoll engine and also to allow running SSL post checks
  with the OpenSSL objects created in those cases. API added:

  - noPollSslContextCreator (handler)
  - noPollSslPostCheck (handler)
  - nopoll_ctx_set_ssl_context_creator
  - nopoll_ctx_set_post_ssl_check

* [fix] Adding initial code to implement client side peer certificate
  verification (test_21). Added API to get listener associated to the
  client:

  - nopoll_conn_get_listener.

* [new] General API update to allow support to control ssl peer
  verification process. This is now done by the API:

  - nopoll_conn_opts_ssl_peer_verify

  By default listeners do not verify peer certificate but clients
  do.

  (added reg test 21 to check this new support)

* [new] Added general API update to support server side client
  certificate verification by using previous API and allowing to also
  setup CA certificates and chain. API added:

  - nopoll_conn_opts_set_ssl_certs

  (added reg test 21 to check this new support)

* [fix] General connection options API update to allow handling
  references so it can be shared among threads and different
  connections. API added:

  - nopoll_conn_opts_ref
  - nopoll_conn_opts_unref

* [fix] Fixed noPoll ssl module to use provided chain certificate by
  the API caller (upps).

* [fix] General engine update to allow listeners to be controlled by
  connection options in a particular manner.

* [fix] Added regression test to check connection close handler
  triggered for regular connections and ssl ones. Nothing wrong
  found. Everything working.  Reg test added: test_22

* [fix] Added test_23 to check connection close notification for TLS
  connections.  Nothing wrong found. Everything working as expected.

* [fix] Added connection close just after receiving close frame to
  ensure the connection close process is triggered as fast as
  possible..and also to ensure it is triggered because some clients do
  not do it.

* [fix] Added additional documentation on how to use noPoll TLS API to
  implement server side peer certificate verification, TLS post check
  and SSL context creator handlers.
