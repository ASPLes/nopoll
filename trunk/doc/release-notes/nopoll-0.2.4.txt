                          0.2.4

Advanced Software Production Line is proud to announce a new stable
release of the noPoll toolkit.

noPoll is a OpenSource WebSocket implementation (RFC 6455), written in
ANSI C, that allows building pure WebSocket solutions or to provide
WebSocket support to existing TCP oriented applications.

Commercially supported, noPoll was written to have a clean, easy to
use and integrate library. It is released under the terms of LGPL 2.1
(so you can build OpenSource or commercial applications) and currently
is being heavily used by Vortex Library, Turbulence and Core-Admin to
provide WebSocket support to those projects (some of them using BEEP
over WebSocket).

This release in short
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  New stable release that support reading partial frames (part of the
  header or part of the mask) without consider that as a failure and
  without blocking the caller. Next calls will reuse those bytes to
  try to complete incoming data.

Changes from previous release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* [fix] Updated log handling to avoid showing logs when ctx reference
  isn't defined.

* [fix] Updated nopoll_conn to implement a micro pause after each
  failing operation that needs retry to avoid calling to retry too
  fast.

* [fix] Implemented several fixings to support reading in a
  non-blocking manner incomplete frames (that aren't complete because
  the content didn't arrive yet). Added test 17 to check incomplete
  frames after header, after mask and/or after partial content.
