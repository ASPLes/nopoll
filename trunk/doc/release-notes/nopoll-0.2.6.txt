                          0.2.6

Advanced Software Production Line is proud to announce a new stable
release of the noPoll toolkit.

noPoll is a OpenSource WebSocket implementation (RFC 6455), written in
ANSI C, that allows building pure WebSocket solutions or to provide
WebSocket support to existing TCP oriented applications.

Commercially supported, noPoll was written to have a clean, easy to
use and integrate library. It is released under the terms of LGPL 2.1
(so you can build OpenSource or commercial applications) and currently
is being heavily used by Vortex Library, Turbulence and Core-Admin to
provide WebSocket support to those projects (some of them using BEEP
over WebSocket).

This release in short
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  New stable release that includes several corrections. Updated
  connection code to implement/support really slow connection (using
  configurable EWOULD_BLOCK and EINPROGRESS).

Thanks to
~~~~~~~~~

- Mario Castelán Castro (reported nopoll_loop_wait's reentrance
  failure).

- Konstantin (reported a path to receive on_msg_data at on_msg
  handler).

Changes from previous release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* [fix] Fixed an error about unused variables at nopoll.c and added
  support to create packages for wheezy.

* [fix] Added references to wheezy packages. Added references into the
  web to warn users from using these packages if they are using
  Core-Admin.

* [fix] Fixed support to make nopoll_loop_wait to be callable any
  number of times. Updated nopoll-regression-client.c (test_18) to
  reproduce bug and check fix introduced. Bug reported by Mario
  Castelán Castro.

* [fix] Applied Konstantin's patch to make on_msg handler to receive
  on_msg_data reference from the ctx object when this is the one with
  the handler defined. Reported and fixed by Konstantin Eremeev.

* [fix] Some modifications at nopoll_connect functions to make them to
  implement a I/O waiting mechanism when it is found EWOULD BLOCK and
  EINPROGRESS.
