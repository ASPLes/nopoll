Advanced Software Production Line is proud to announce the first
public stable release of noPoll toolkit.

noPoll is a OpenSource WebSocket implementation (RFC 6455), written in
ANSI C, that allows building pure WebSocket solutions or to provide
WebSocket support to existing TCP oriented applications.

noPoll was written to have a clean, easy to use and integrate
library. It is released under the terms of LGPL 2.1 (so you can build
OpenSource or commercial applications) and currently is being heavily
used by Vortex Library, Turbulence and Core-Admin to provide with
WebSocket support to those projects (BEEP over WebSocket).
