                          0.3.2

Advanced Software Production Line is proud to announce a new stable
release of the noPoll toolkit.

noPoll is a OpenSource WebSocket implementation (RFC 6455), written in
ANSI C, that allows building pure WebSocket solutions or to provide
WebSocket support to existing TCP oriented applications.

Commercially supported, noPoll was written to have a clean, easy to
use and integrate library. It is released under the terms of LGPL 2.1
(so you can build OpenSource or commercial applications) and currently
is being heavily used by Vortex Library, Turbulence and Core-Admin to
provide WebSocket support to those projects (some of them using BEEP
over WebSocket).

This release in short
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - Implemented get close reason and close status when it is reported
    by remote peer. Added support to close a connection sending a close
    status and a close reason.

  - Added/Fixed FreeBSD support (ENOTCONN handling). Added FreeBSD 
    packaging support.

  - Various compilation fixes were resolved (clang) and other minor
    stable updates.

Changes from previous release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* [fix] Fixed FreeBSD support. ENOTCONN wasn't handled on connection. For
  some reason socket API is reported ENOTCONN when the should be reporting
  EINPROGRESS or EWOULDBLOCK

* [fix] Updated log handler reporting so it is triggering when a user handler
  is configured via nopoll_log_set_handler (even in the case log reporting
  is disabled).

* [fix] Added new option call --show-only-critical to regression tests client
  to show only critical messages.

* [fix] Updated noPoll internal handling to support close frames with
  body content so remote peer status and reason are now available to API
  consumers. A new couple of functions are now available to these values:

  - nopoll_conn_get_close_reason
  - nopoll_conn_get_close_status

  Still need more work to check and add a regression test..

* [fix] Updated nopoll_conn_wait_util_connection_ready uses nopoll_conn_is_ok()
  and the end of the function and the result reported is linked to its results..


* [new] Updated noPoll conn API to include a new function to allow closing
  a connection, sending an error message and an error code along with it:

  - nopoll_conn_close_ext

* [fix] Added regression test (test_28) to check connection close frame
  with status and reason to check functions added:

  - nopoll_conn_get_close_status 
  - nopoll_conn_get_close_reason

  Everything working as expected..

* [fix] Added support to provide FreeBSD packages (for now 9.X releases).

* [fix] Fixed warnings reported by clang...gcc didn't notice them :-??
