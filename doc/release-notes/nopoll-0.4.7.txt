Advanced Software Production Line is proud to announce a new stable
release of the noPoll toolkit.

noPoll is a OpenSource WebSocket implementation (RFC 6455), written in
ANSI C, that allows building pure WebSocket solutions or to provide
WebSocket support to existing TCP oriented applications.

Commercially supported, noPoll was written to have a clean, easy to
use and integrate library. It is released under the terms of LGPL 2.1
(so you can build OpenSource or commercial applications) and currently
is being heavily used by Vortex Library, Turbulence and Core-Admin to
provide WebSocket support to those projects (some of them using BEEP
over WebSocket).

This release in short
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  - Stable release with bug fixing, support for Debian Stretch and
    Ubuntu Bionic

Thanks to
~~~~~~~~~

  - Javier Celaya [github.com/jcelaya] (warn about incomplet read/writes)

  - @qianqiangliu [github.com/qianqiangliu] (format parameter strings).

  - @bill.williams [github.com/bill.williams] (fixed error logs)

  - @samisallinen [github.com/samisallinen] (fixed npoll_cmp issue)

  - @mhennecke [github.com/mhennecke] (reported client side SNI issue)

Changes from previous release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* [fix] Do not warn about incomplete read/write operations

  Log messages about not reading or writing as much data as requested
  are tagged as warnings, while this is a perfectly normal situation
  when dealing with non-blocking sockets. This results in lots of
  unwanted warning messages. This commit tags them as debug messages.

* [fix] Adding support for Debian Stretch

* [fix] Fixed libssl1.1 reference for Debian Stretch.

* [fix] Fixed missing parameter to format string at nopoll_conn.c:3197
  Reported by @qianqiangliu. Thanks!

* [fix] Minor fixings to regression-client.c

* [fix] connect error log to report the correct errno

* [fix] Fix connect error log to report the correct errno:
   In function __nopoll_conn_sock_connect_opts_internal, after a connect failure, the log statement 
   is currently placed after the socket shutdown and close, so that errno may by changed before the 
   message is printed.

   This change moves the log statement to before the socket shutdown and close, so that errno is 
   reported correctly.

* [fix] Fixed nopoll_cmp internal check (reported by @samisallinen).
  Closes https://github.com/ASPLes/nopoll/issues/65

* [fix] Configure SNI indication on TLS client connection. 
  Closes https://github.com/ASPLes/nopoll/pull/63. Reported by @mhennecke

* [fix] Updated regression test17 to include content
  direction. Reverting wrong path to header initialization
  values. Added documentation to avoid failing on the same.

  Reverting patch (r398 | ananthakrishnan) restoring initial right
  values. Added documentation to explain that these are the right
  values to make test to run without error.

* [fix] Adding files to support Ubuntu 18 Bionic

* [fix] More fixings to Ubuntu 18 Bionic packaging

* [fix] Added new function, connection option, to allow controlling if
  Origin header is added to client init transation:

  - nopoll_conn_opts_add_origin_header

  By default Origin header is always added unless otherwise
  configured. Library keeps working the same: it always provides
  Origin header (either provided by user or inferred by library)
  unless not configured with this API.

* [fix] Updated client side __nopoll_conn_get_client_init to support
  not generating Origin header in case it is not defined or it was
  disabled by user by calling:

  - nopoll_conn_opts_add_origin_header (opts, nopoll_false)

* [fix] Making opts to be optional at __nopoll_conn_get_client_init

* [fix] Updated nopoll_conn_read_pending documentation to better reflect how
  to use it and some pointers to example.
