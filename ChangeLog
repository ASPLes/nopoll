	* [fix] Internal documentation updates..

2017-01-20  Javier Celaya  <javier.celaya@flexvdi.com>

	Fix handling pending write data
	When SSL_write returns EAGAIN, it keeps a pointer to the data buffer
	that was being written. This buffer must exist the next time that
	SSL_write is called. So, this commit recycles the send_buffer in
	nopoll_conn_send_frame as pending_write, instead of creating a new
	buffer and copying so many data around.

	Besides, nopoll_conn_send_frame correctly returns all the bytes as
	written, since they are kept in the pending_write buffer. Otherwise,
	the caller will try to write the same data again.
